### dict

Służy głównie do iteracji z indeksem

```python
string = 'Hello world'
for index, char in enumerate(string):
    print(f'Znak {index} to: `{char}`')
# Znak 0 to: `H`
# Znak 1 to: `e`
# Znak 2 to: `l`
# Znak 3 to: `l`
# Znak 4 to: `o`
# Znak 5 to: ` `
# Znak 6 to: `w`
# Znak 7 to: `o`
# Znak 8 to: `r`
# Znak 9 to: `l`
# Znak 10 to: `d`
